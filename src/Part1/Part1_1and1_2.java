The descendants of node 8: Node 8 has descendants 5, 6, and 2, 9.
The ancestors of node 1 is node 3
The leaf nodes in this tree are 5, 9, 1, and 4
The internal nodesare 7, 8, 6, 2, 3.
    Node 3 is at level 1
    Node 1 is at level 2
    Node 9 is at level 4
    The height of the tree is 4
    The height of the subtree rooted at 6 is 2
     No, in a full binary tree,
     every node other than the leaves has two children, but nodes 6, 2 have one child.
     We shoule move node 9 that way so it would be left son of a node 6.
     a - 7, 8, 3, 5, 6, 1, 4, 2, 9
     b - 5, 8, 9, 2, 6, 7, 1, 3, 4
     c - 7, 8, 5, 6, 2, 9, 3, 1, 4
     d - 5, 9, 2, 6, 8, 1, 4, 3, 7
